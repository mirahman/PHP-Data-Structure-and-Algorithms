# PHP Data Structures and Algorithms

Data structure and Algorithm is always important for any programming language. PHP, being one of the most popular language for web development, also requires the pure data structure and algorithm implementations. 

In this project, i am trying to cover major data structure and algorithm implementations using PHP 7. For more details discussion about the topics, you can read my book , https://www.amazon.com/PHP-7-Data-Structures-Algorithms/dp/178646389X/

Any feedback, bugs or suggestion will be welcomed.

I know lots of things are missing in the list? Would you mind to let me know what you wanna see implemented? I will priortize those and add here.
